# Weekly notes

This week has been quite busy at work but I have had some time at working on my Chinese as well as an audio side-project.

## Learning Chinese
During the week I found [a post](https://www.chinese-forums.com/forums/topic/60773-how-i-learned-4000-characters-or-tuttlematthews-“learning-chinese-characters-–-part-2”/) on *chinese-forums.com* where someone described his approach to learning 4000+ Chinese characters. I'm still at around 2000 where I've been stuck a while. I thought I could increase my vocabulary by primary reading, but I've realised that this maybe isn't enough by itself. 

The method he is using is similar to how I studied when I started learning Chinese back in 2014, but he stuck with it for far longer than me. Basically, you learn a few stories related to the components of the characters (I used [Learning Chinese Characters - Tuttle](https://www.amazon.com/Tuttle-Learning-Chinese-Characters-Revolutionary-ebook/dp/B00KV1SK1E)). This guy continued creating stories for over 3000 characters more. 

I read it and started Googling about memory techniques for learning Chinese and stumbled upon [this post](https://mullenmemory.com/memory-palace/chinese-system-part-2) by Alex Mullen, a memory champion, which builds upon [this system](http://countryoftheblind.blogspot.com/2012/01/mnemonics-for-pronouncing-chinese.html) by Serge Gorodish, an American mathematican. 

After reading I started working on my own encoding for the pronunciation of characters. I am still adapting it to famous people I'm more familiar with.


## Realtime audio transcription
Since I want to learn more about machine learning for audio I thought I could try my hand on creating a self hosted realtime transcription service from the browser.

I started last weekend and have been working on it for a few mornings during the week.

Facebook recently released a pretrained self-supervised model ([Wav2vec 2.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11477)) which I have been playing around with for a bit.

To stream audio directly from the browser to a server I'm using a python implementation of webRTC called *[aiortc](https://aiortc.readthedocs.io)*.

I've run into some problems with not getting very good audio quality which I hope to figure out the coming week.


## Presentation
Since I'm responsible for a new project I also need to start pitching the project internally. I did a first presentation for a few higher-ups at HSBC this Friday. After the presentation I got a recommendation to take a look at two videos about pitching:
- [A TED talk by Simon Sinek](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en)
- [The magical science of story telling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj-hdQMa3uA)
